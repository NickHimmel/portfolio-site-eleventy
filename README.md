# Nick Himmel's Portfolio Webiste

This portfolio is built with the [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) static site generator.

This is my portfolio website. I am a web developer and artist living in New York City. I recently completed Dev Bootcamp, an intensive web development program in New York City, where I acquired advanced skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React. Before that, I earned a master's degree in digital photography from SVA.
