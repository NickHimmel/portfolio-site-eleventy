### Personal project to further my React and Redux skills.

This app lets people click on a district on a dynamic map of the United States to find out who their representative is and who their senators are. It shows constituents the lawmakersâ€™ finances, bills they have introduced, their vote history, and provides links to their social media pages. Built with the D3.js JavaScript library, as well as the ProPublica API and OpenSecrets API. 

**TECHNOLOGY:** React, Redux, D3, Sass </br> [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/NickHimmel/my-politician-app) / [Visit Site](https://nickhimmel.github.io/my-politician-app/)
