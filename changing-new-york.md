## My Politician
### Personal project to further my React and Redux skills.

This app lets people click on a district on a dynamic map of the United States to find out who their local congressman is as well as who their state representatives are. It shows constituents which bills the lawmaker introduced, their vote history, and provides links to their social media pages. Built with the D3.js JavaScript library, as well as the ProPublica API and OpenSecrets API.

TECHNOLOGY: React, Redux, D3, Sass
