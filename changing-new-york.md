### Personal project to further my React and Redux skills.

This app uses my own photographs paired with Berenice Abbott’s historic photographs from the New York York Public Library Digital Collections API, along with Mapbox, to engage users in a conversation about New York’s changing waterfront. Users can click on locations on a map of New York’s waterfront to see historic photos paired with contemporary ones and read about the area’s development.

**TECHNOLOGY:** React, Redux, D3, Sass </br> [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/NickHimmel/changing-new-york-app) / [Visit Site](https://changing-new-york-app.herokuapp.com/)
