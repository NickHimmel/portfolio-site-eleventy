## Civil Media WordPress Theme
### Freelance Front End Developer, April 2018 – present.

Civil is a blockchain startup focusing on journalism. They have a custom WordPress theme for small independent newsrooms. I adapted Civil’s WordPress theme to the individual needs of 11 different newsrooms using CSS. I worked with each newsroom to learn their needs and brand and make their sites look exactly the way they wanted.

TECHNOLOGY: CSS, WordPress
